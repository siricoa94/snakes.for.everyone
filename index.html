    <header>Snakes for Everyone!</header>
   
    <p>Snakes can be very long, some growing over 30 feet in length. Snakes can come in all sorts of colors, including yellow and orange.
        Snakes can open their mouth much wider and larger than their head appears to be since they have hinged jaws that are not connected to eachother.
        Snakes are cold blooded creatures and require an external source for body heat.
